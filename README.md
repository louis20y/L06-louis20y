## Overview

The main goal of this lab is to introduce and build an ensemble using `{stacks}`. Reading and reviewing `{stacks}`'s [homepage](https://stacks.tidymodels.org/index.html) and the [Getting Started With stacks vignette](https://stacks.tidymodels.org/articles/basics.html). The latter of which will be very helpful since we will be following the general workflow that is outlined in it.

## Instructions

After creating a github repo and connecting it to RStudio, students should work through the instructions provided in `LO6_ensemble_models.html`.

Students will need to submit their knitted html file which should contain a link to their github repo. See canvas for submission details.
